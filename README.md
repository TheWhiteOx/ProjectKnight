ProjectKnight
=============
A project to learn the Meteor Framework - Inspired by MUDs
My very first web app on my journey to becoming a software engineer.  Please don't mind the code ugliness!  

A live instance of the project is deployed at projectknight.meteor.com


      You can login as a new player to roam around the world
      
      Or you can log in as a builder with these credentials and start building rooms!:
      email: builder@builder.com
      password: builder

  Please don't mind the ugly and unwieldly UI! It's a massive work in progress.

##Features:
    Real-time chatting system.
    Voice commands for moving rooms (north south east west up down).
    Voice commands for chatting into the room.
    Realtime NPC and room building (due to Meteor's reactive nature).

##Todo:
    Lots and lots and lots of code cleanup and abstraction.
    UI overhaul of the builder panel.
    A definite rewrite for Meteor 1.0 (This is based on Meteor 0.8.3)


    A tiny step down the programming rabbithole and a lifetime's journey towards code elegance.
